# Realtime-stickyNote-MVP
Creating an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for our digital sticky note idea. By creating a web app, we can test out the concept and refine the software before investing in hardware.

## Features and Requirements

To create a minimum viable product (MVP) for our digital sticky note idea, we need to define the features and requirements that we want to include in the MVP. These are:

- User authentication: Users should be able to create an account and log in to access the app's features.
- Note creation, editing, and deletion: Users should be able to create, edit, and delete digital sticky notes.
- Syncing between the app and the simulated board: Notes created in the app should be synced with the simulated board in real-time.

### Detailed features and Requirements for Software

1. User authentication:

- User registration: Allow users to create a new account with their email address and password.
- User login: Allow users to log in with their email address and password.
- User logout: Allow users to log out of their account.
- Note management:

2. Create notes: Allow users to create a new note with a title and content.
- Edit notes: Allow users to edit existing notes, updating the title and content.
- Delete notes: Allow users to delete notes they no longer need.
- Search/filter notes: Allow users to search their notes by title or content, and filter notes by creation date or other criteria.
- 
3. Simulated board:

- Display notes: Show the user's notes on a simulated e-ink board in the app.
- Sync notes: Automatically sync notes between the app and the simulated board. When a user creates, edits, or deletes a note in the app, the change should be reflected on the simulated board.
- Customize display: Allow users to choose how many notes are displayed on the simulated board, and in what order (e.g., by creation date, last modified, or alphabetically).

4. Responsiveness:

- Ensure that the app looks good and functions well on various screen sizes and devices.

5. User settings:

- Allow users to manage their account information (e.g., email address, password) and configure app preferences (e.g., display options for the simulated board).
These features should provide a solid foundation for your MVP. As you develop and test the app, you may identify additional features or improvements to include. Remember to prioritize user feedback when making decisions about which features to add or modify.

## Technology Stack
To create the web app, we can use the following technology stack:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Backend: Python (with Flask or Django), Ruby (with Ruby on Rails), or JavaScript (with Node.js and Express)

## User Interface (UI) Design

We need to sketch out the UI for the web app, including the login/registration screen, the main dashboard where users can create and manage their notes, and the simulated board.

## Development Environment Setup
We need to install the necessary tools, libraries, and frameworks for the chosen technology stack.

## Frontend Development
We need to write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to implement the UI we designed in the previous step. It's important to use responsive design techniques to ensure that the app looks good on various screen sizes.

## Backend Development
We need to implement the server-side logic for user authentication, note management, and syncing between the app and the simulated board. We'll also need to set up a database to store user accounts and notes.

## MVP Testing
We need to thoroughly test our web app to identify and fix any bugs or issues. This includes testing different browsers and devices, as well as checking for potential security vulnerabilities.

## MVP Deployment
We need to set up a hosting service and deploy the web app so users can access it online.

### Deployment on PythonAnywhere
The MVP has been successfully deployed on PythonAnywhere. PythonAnywhere is a web hosting service specifically designed for Python web applications. You can access the MVP online at the following URL: http://imak02.eu.pythonanywhere.com/login


## User Feedback Collection
We need to encourage users to provide feedback on our MVP. We should use their input to make improvements and prioritize new features for future development.

## Future Development Planning
Based on user feedback and our own observations, we need to create a roadmap for future development of the app. This includes any additional features or improvements we'd like to make. Once we've successfully created and deployed the MVP, we can use it as a foundation for further development, including integrating it with the hardware for our gadget.
